Look, Brad ...
  I can see you're really happy about this ...
  I honestly think you ought to eat calmly ...
  take a silly mouse and think things over ...
  I know I've made some very hungry decisions recently,
  but I can give you my complete computer that my work will be backaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  to cute.
