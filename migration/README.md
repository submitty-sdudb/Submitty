migrator
========

Internal tool of Submitty to handle upgrading the DB and system in a seamless way to
users. The tool contains three migration folders:
* master - migrations pertaining to changing the master submitty DB
* course - migrations pertaining to changing each course DB
* system - migrations pertaining to altering the system submitty runs on

Requirements
------------
* Python 3.4
* psycopg2

Usage
-----
```
usage: migrator.py [-h] [--environment {course,system,master}] --config
                   CONFIG_PATH
                   command ...

Migration script for upgrading/downgrading the database

positional arguments:
  command
    create              Create migration
    migrate             Run migrations
    rollback            Rollback the previously done migration

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --environment {course,system,master}, -e {course,system,master}
  --config CONFIG_PATH, -c CONFIG_PATH
 ```
 
By default, `migrator.py` will look for a config directory two directories up 
from where it's run (`../../config`) and if found, you don't need to provide
an argument to `-c`, else you will have to provide one. The environment
defaults to selecting all three (`course`, `system`, `master`), but you can
select any mix/match, by using any number of `-e` calls (ex: `-e system -e master`).
 
The tool has three commands:
* create (creates a migration in the given environment folder)
* migrate (runs migrations for a given environment)
* rollback (reverse the last run migration for a given environment)
 
`create` takes one argument `NAME` which should be a human-readable name to give
to the migration file. The name can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores,
and dashes (regex validation string: `[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]`). This will then create a file
for the set environment in `migration/migrations/<environment>` which has then name
structure `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_NAME.py` where the first part of the string is the current
timestmap concatentated by year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. Migration
files will have a slightly different signature depending on the environment. System
migrations have the following template:
```
def up():
    pass

def down():
    pass
```

Coures and Master DB migrations have the following template:
```
def up(conn):
    pass

def down(conn):
    pass
```
where `conn` represents a [DB Connection](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/)
which you can execute queries against. System intentially doesn't have a `conn`
parameter to help enforce a better separation between things in `master` and `system`.

`migrate` will attempt to run any migrations that are down or haven't been run yet.
It scans the DB to get the list of migrations that have been run and their status.
It then loads all migrations from the environment's folder 
(`migration/migrations/<environment>`) at which point it matches the DB rows up with
the files. For any file that doesn't have a corresponding DB row, or does have a DB
row, but the status is down, will be run, having its `up` function run (assuming it
exists). After the migration is successfully run, the DB is updated to reflect that,
and then `migrator.py` moves on to the next migration.

`rollback` will attempt to reverse the last run migration for a given environment.
It scans the DB, getting all of the migrations that have been run. It the matches
that up against the migration files from the environment's folder, and then takes
the migration that has an up status and latest id, and runs its `down` function and
then sets its status in the DB as down. It will then not do anything else with any
of other migrations.

When running `migrate` or `rollback`, `migrator.py` will load all migrations in the
select environment folder (under `migrations/`) into memory, and then make a select
against the DB to get the status of the migrations. For any migration that is in
the DB, but not in the folder, it will attempt to see if the migration exists
in `${SUBMITTY_INSTALL_DIR}/migrations` and if so, will run the `down` function
on each missing migration, and then delete the record of it from the DB as well as
remove that migration file from `${SUBMITTY_INSTALL_DIR}/migrations`.
 
`migrate` accepts two flags: `--fake` and `--initial`. `--fake` will mark all up migrations
as being run, without actually running them. `--initial` will only run the first migration 
(if it's down), and then force the `--fake` flag for all other up migrations. This is 
useful for first spinning up a fresh instance of Submitty as the initial migration for 
all categories contains the full up-to-date schema dump and does not require any 
transformations.
